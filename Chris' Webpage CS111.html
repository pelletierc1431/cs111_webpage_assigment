<h2>About me:</h2>  
<p>Some things that interest me in terms of hobbies or sports can include baseball, and golf. I have played baseball ever since I was six years old playing t-ball to now at 18 playing college ball here at Huntington University as a freshman. It has always been a goal of mine to play baseball at the next level, from summer ball, to high school, and now to college. Aside from baseball, golf has always been an interest of mine especially in the summer whenever I may have free time. I have taught myself to be good by going every so often at loccal courses back at home. Although golf may seem fun, it is not very forgiving! It can be very frustrating and also very expensive depending on the location. </p> 
<br>
<strong>In terms of career goals, it is important for me to achive good grades in college to get me a good job later in life. I lean in the direction of being a Computer Sciennce major here at Huntington. As a kid I loved to build things and construct little designs such as legos and even tiny houses with popsicle sticks. Althogh, as I grew older and gained more knowledge, coding has always been an interest of mine which is what I will be taking a stab at within my time here. My uncle was a Cimputer Science major in college and he now owns three different business' which means it can take you in any direction you may wish. This is a very important and also exciting path for me to look forward to in the future.</strong>
