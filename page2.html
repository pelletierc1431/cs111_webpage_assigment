<h2>About me:</h2>  

<body>My Favorite Foods can include both seafood and steak. These are my favorite ever since I had a meal down on the coast of Alabama in Gulf Shores at a resturant called "The Hangout." They had a surf and turf trio that consisted of shrimp fish and steak. They were all very fresh since we were right off the coast and it had a taste unlike anything I had ever tasted before. Ever since this moment steak and seafood has been my favorite food.</h2>
